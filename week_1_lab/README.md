# Week 1 Lab  - Introduction to the command line, GitHub, and Python. 

### Motivation
In this class, and in your careers, being comfortable with command line interfaces will ensure that you can interact with any interface, and will provide you with much more control and power of the tools we use in the digital world. Additionally, collaboration and version control are necessities for software development from solo developers, to entire teams. For this, tools like git and implementations like GitHub are pivotal in ensuring maintable and collaberative project management. Finally, while there are many excellent programming languages used in modern software engineering (C++, JavaScript, Java, etc.), Python is the definitive language for data science and machine learning.

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will be working with all of these tools to manage your python programming and software development. By the end of this lab you will:
- Be comfortable navigating through files and folders using the command line.
- Write simple python files, execute them, and update them from the command line.
- Create and manage code repositories using GitHub.


## Part 1 - Setting Up GitHub, VSCode, and Python
- Sign up for / log in to your GitHub account.
- Ensure Python3 is installed on your machine.
- Same for VSCode.
- Read the `gitflow.md` file.
- Install Git on your machine and add your username/password so you can push changes to your GitHub account.
- Install Homebrew on macOS, install the git cli (`brew install gh` and follow the steps) OR `https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md` for Linux

## Part 2 - Navigating the terminal
- Read the `terminal.md` file
- Clone this Repo to your machine.
  
## Part 3 - Creating a new python file and runnning commands from the command line
- Go to your github and create a new repo
- Clone this empty repo to your machine
- Copy over the `lab_task` folder
- Solve the tasks in the python file
- Commit and push the solution to your GitHub
